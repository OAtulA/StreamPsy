# Here is a basic outline of how you can create a site to stream and add people using the MERN stack:

## Step 1: Set up your backend using Node.js and Express
- Create a new Node.js project.
- Install Express to handle routing.
- Set up your server to listen on a specific port.

## Step 2: Implement user authentication
- Use a library like Passport.js for authentication.
- Set up routes for user registration and login.

## Step 3: Create a database using MongoDB
- Install MongoDB and Mongoose for database interaction.
- Define schemas for users and any other data you need to store.

## Step 4: Build the frontend using React
- Create React components for your site's UI.
- Use React Router for navigation.
- Connect your frontend to the backend API using Axios or Fetch.

## Step 5: Implement video streaming
- Integrate a video streaming service like Vimeo or YouTube API.
- Allow users to add videos by providing a link or uploading directly.

## Step 6: Add people by creating a link
- Implement a feature where users can generate unique links to share with others.
- Use these links to connect people within your site.

## Step 7: Deploy your site
- Choose a hosting provider like Heroku or AWS.
- Deploy both your frontend and backend applications.

Remember to handle error cases, input validation, and security measures throughout the development process.
